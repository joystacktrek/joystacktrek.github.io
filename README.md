## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account (or create one if you don't have it yet).
- Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and choose "New repository."
- Give your repository a name, such as "your-username.github.io" (replace "your-username" with your actual GitHub username).
- Choose to make it a public repository (so it can be accessible as a GitHub Page).

## Step 2: Push Your Bio Page Files
- On your local computer, ensure that your bio page files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) are organized within a folder with a meaningful name (e.g., "bio-page").
- Initialize a new Git repository in the folder (if you haven't already) by running these commands in the terminal or command prompt:
  ```
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

- Link your local repository to the GitHub remote repository you created in Step 1:
  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git
  ```

- Push your local files to the GitHub repository:
  ```
  git push -u origin master
  ```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to your GitHub repository's settings.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Choose the "main" branch as the source for GitHub Pages.
- Click "Save."

## Step 4: Access Your Deployed Bio Page
- After saving the settings, GitHub Pages will generate a URL for your deployed bio page (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io`).
- It might take a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your page to be accessible at that URL.

## Step 5: Keep Your Page Updated
- Whenever you make changes to your bio page, commit the changes locally, and push them to the GitHub repository:
  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "Update bio page"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Your changes will be automatically reflected on your GitHub Pages URL.

Now, your bio page is live on GitHub Pages, and you can share the URL with others to introduce yourself and showcase your work. Remember to keep your page up to date and add any new projects or achievements to continually impress potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
